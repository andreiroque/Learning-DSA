# Binary Tree

This is for understanding how Binary Tree works and in this small project I renamed the node as BTNode because in Main.java cannot recognize the Node.java in the same directory, I am guessing the Node.java in the Tree directory has something to do with this.

I also copied (I typed it all line-by-line and I didn't just copy and pasted it) the all the functions in the Main.java from a website called [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/print-binary-tree-2-dimensions/) to print the binary tree in 2-Dimensions (using inorder traversal).
